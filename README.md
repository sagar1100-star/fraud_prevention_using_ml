🔍 Features:
Trained model to detect fraudulent transactions.

User interface to test new transaction inputs.

Lightweight static front-end with model integration.

🧠 Technologies Used:
Python

Scikit-learn / Pandas / NumPy

HTML, CSS (for UI)

🚀 How It Works:
Load dataset containing transaction data.

Preprocess and train a machine learning model.

Accept new transaction inputs via UI.
