# 🛡️ Fraud Prevention Using Machine Learning

This project is focused on detecting fraudulent transactions in e-commerce platforms using machine learning techniques. It uses a classification model to predict whether a transaction is **fraudulent** or **legitimate** based on transaction data.

## 🚀 Features

- Detects fraudulent transactions using trained ML model
- Simple, static UI for user interaction
- Lightweight and easy to run
- Educational and beginner-friendly project

---

## 🧠 Built With

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook
- HTML & CSS

## 💻 How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**
git clone https://github.com/sagar1100-star/fraud_prevention_using_ml.git cd fraud_prevention_using_ml

2. **Install Required Libraries**
> Make sure Python is installed. Then run:
pip install -r requirements.txt
> 
3. **Run the Notebook**
- Open `fraud_detection_model.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
- Run all the cells to train and evaluate the model.

4. **View the Interface**
- Open `index.html` in your browser.
- Currently, it’s a static UI (not yet connected to the ML model).
